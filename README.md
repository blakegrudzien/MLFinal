# MLFinal
Machine Learning Final (Basketball Stats)
This study investigates the potential of machine learning (ML) models to enhance profitability in
NBA sports betting, with the assumption that traditional betting is inherently losing. Using a
comprehensive dataset from NBA seasons spanning 1997-2023, we examine the accuracy of various
ML models including neural networks, linear regression, and k-nearest neighbors. Our objective is
to identify the most effective model for predicting player point performances and to compute the
expected value of bets for the 2022-2023 NBA season. This paper aims to challenge the prevailing
narrative that 'the house always wins' by exploring strategic, data-informed betting approaches.
Our findings intend to contribute significantly to the discourse on the fairness and predictability of
sports betting, providing insights that could reshape betting strategies and sports analytics.
